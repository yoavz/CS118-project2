Project 2 
=========

This project was completed by Yoav Zimmerman and Noah Hadfield-Menell

Yoav Zimmerman completed the code required for the ARP requests and reply's. 
This includes all the code that handles placing packets in queue's when they're 
waiting on a given ARP reply to come in and the code that sends them once the
ARP reply comes in.

Noah Hadfield-Menell completed the code that creates and sends ICMP protocol 
messages of different types. In addition, he wrote the business logic that
decides when to send what type of ICMP message. 

Together, they plugged the rest of the business logic required for the router.
In total, approximately 15-20 hours were spent working on this project
